# Virtual Pet Simulator

*NOTE: This code runs on Greenfoot API*

## Foreword

Welcome to my Virtual Pet Simulator! Meet Bunny! Bunny loves to eat and play, so please interact with him as muchyou'd like. Just make sure that he is happy and healthy at all times :) Thanks for playing my game!

## Basic Information

♥ Bunny's stats can be seen in the bottom left hand corner. There are 3 health stats: hunger, energy, and happiness

♥ The hunger stat starts at 100% and will decrease by 1% every 100 acts. If the hunger stat reaches 0%, Bunny will die. To prevent this from happening, please feed       bunny

♥ The energy stat starts at 100% and will decrease by 1% every 50 acts. If the energy stat reaches 0%, Bunny will automatically fall asleep to regain all of his         energy. During this time, you will not be able to interact with Bunny until he wakes up

♥ The happiness stat starts at 100% and will decrease by 1% every 75 acts. There are no consequences if the happiness stat reaches 0%, but please do not let this         happen as it will make Bunny sad. To increase Bunny's happiness, either click on him or give him toys

♥ At the top of the screen, there is a tool bar containing 6 objects that Bunny can interact with: Petfood, Coffee, a Ukulele, a Camera, a Scooter, and a Cape

## How to Feed Bunny

♥ Bunny can eat 2 things: Petfood and Coffee

♥ To feed Bunny, you must drag either the Petfood or the Coffee, which is located in the tool bar, to Bunny

♥ Once the food item is given to Bunny, he will change his image and his hunger stat will increase

♥ If Bunny's hunger reaches 0%, Bunny will die and the game will be over

## How to Play With Bunny

♥ If you click on Bunny, Bunny will feel happy and his happiness will increase by 5%. However, if you click on Bunny too many times, Bunny will eventually get mad       because his impatience is too high and his happiness will not go up anymore if you continue to click him

♥ *NOTE: Bunny's impatience stat cannot be seen, and will increase every time you click on him. Bunny's impatience will also increase faster when he is sleepy*

♥ You can also play with Bunny by making him interact with his toys, which are all in the tool bar. To do so, you can drag his Ukulele, Camera, Scooter, or Cape to       him

♥ Once you give a toy to Bunny for him to play with, he will change his image and his happiness stat will increase

## How to Get Bunny to Follow You

♥ If you click on the screen, Bunny will move to where your mouse is

♥ Bunny will also move if you use the 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', and 'RIGHT' keys

♥ If you leave Bunny to his own devices, Bunny will randomly move on his own every 250 acts

♥ SPECIAL FEATURES: If Bunny plays with the Scooter or the Cape, he will move faster!

♥ To remove the Cape or the Scooter, simply click Bunny or interact with another toy/food

## How Does Bunny Sleep?

♥ If Bunny's energy is in between 20% and 50%, Bunny will become sleepy. When Bunny is sleepy, he will get more and more impatient

♥ If Bunny's energy is less than 20%, Bunny will fall asleep wherever he is currently standing. When Bunny is asleep, you cannot play, feed, or move him until he         wakes up

## How to Change the Background

♥ In the bottom right-hand corner, there is a button called "Change Background"

♥ If this button is clicked, the background image can change to 1 of 6 different images

♥ Possible backgrounds include: library (default), bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, living room, and the pool

## How to Turn the Music On/Off

♥ In the bottom right-hand corner beside the "Change Background" button, there is a volume button

♥ Clicking on this button will turn the music on or off
